# WeatherAPI

This weather app was created for users wanting to know what the weather is currently like, either in their current location, or in another location with a postcode provided. 



PLANNING STAGE
1. Come up with an idea ✅
- Weather APP that shows people their current and future weather

Dreamer
- Able to take weather from anywhere in the world
- Able to take in postcodes and town names
- Abe to tell the weather for the week 

Realist
- Likely to have a lot of data if for a week 

Critic
- Will need to be well laid out to ensure user is not confused
- May run out of time to complete
- Stick simple and add complexity if time allows


MVP1: 
- Function which takes in a users geolocation and returns the weather for that area. ✅
- Function which takes a valid postcode and returns the weather. ✅ 
- Display current weahther ✅


MVP2:
- Aded complexity to MVP1 - allow people to see the future weather as well for the next 3 days 



REFLECTIONS 
- our team was FAB this week, supporting each other and helping each other through all of our difficulties
- We had a open and honest communication style focusing on building each other up and motivating one another with regular check-ins

FINAL RESULT
- Overall, I am pleased with my current weather app, it is clear.
- If I had more time: I would have liked to have added weather for future days, although this is pseudo coded, my useReducer could do with further work. As well as this, error handling , for example, if someone puts in a postcode that is not valid, currently, no error message has been created

- Thank you for your time ☀
